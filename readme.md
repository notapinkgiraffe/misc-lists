# Misc Lists

## Floss - Cosmo List

There isn't a lot to say, I wanted to take stock of a bunch of Lecien's Cosmo embroidery floss skeins, which I also needed to convert to DMC's embroidery colour codes. It was a bit harder to find lists for Cosmo's colour codes.

When I came across this [COSMO Size 25 Colour Chart](https://www.lecien.co.jp/en/embroidery/floss/cosmo/cosmo25) (which I found through [@tallcoleman](https://github.com/tallcoleman)'s [blog post](https://tallcoleman.me/crafts/2022/01/01/experimenting-rgb-colours-cosmo-embroidery-floss.html) for his [CosmoToRGB project](https://github.com/tallcoleman/CosmoToRGB)), I figured I just needed a text/spreadsheet version of it.

### Formats

* CSV
* Microsoft Excel (XLSX)

### Tools

Not too fancy, copied codes as text from the [COSMO Size 25 Colour Chart](https://www.lecien.co.jp/en/embroidery/floss/cosmo/cosmo25) with [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app/), and formatted text with [Browserling Web Tools' Prefix Lines](https://www.browserling.com/tools/prefix-lines). Then, converted to CSV format and later into Microsoft Excel format.
